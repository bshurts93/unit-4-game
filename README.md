# unit-4-game
jQuery unit homework project


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new GitHub repo called unit-4-game, then clone it to your computer. 

2. Inside the unit-4-game folder, create an index.html file.

3. Still inside the unit-4-game directory, make a folder called assets.
    - Inside the assets directory, make three additional folders: javascript, css and images.
    - In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js.
    - In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
    - In the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code found from the Meyerweb Reset.
    - In the images folder, save any of the images you plan on using.

4. Set up your repository to deploy to Github Pages.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub. 

6. Choose whichever game you want to make from the choices below. The CrystalsCollector game is the recommended option, but if you are looking for an extra hard challenge then take a stab at the Star Wars exercise. (Note: Only choose the Star Wars Exercise if you are feeling very comfortable with the material covered in class. The Crystal Collector activity is plenty challenging enough!).
